Q3. Briefly describe 2 improvements you'd make to this database.

- improvement 1: In the table orders, TOTALAMOUNT could be removed since it
  can be calculated by NETAMOUNT + TAX.
- improvement 2: For the table cust_hist, if there is no specific purpose, it
  can be created by views using the tables orderlines, orders and customers.
